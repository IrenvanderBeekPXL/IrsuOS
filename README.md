# IrsuOS
## THIS IS A SCRIPT TO BUILD IRSUOS USING CUBIC. DO NOT INSTALL THIS ON A USB STICK OR DVD. USE RELEASE FILES FROM THE RELEASE LINK

IrsuOS is an experiment run by youtuber Irsu85 (IrenvanderBeekPXL) to make Linux easy to use for gamers and streamers. I am currently working on Beta, making the final release file as small as possible, fixing bugs, and adding the wanted features

# How to build
(also when testing features for pull requests)
  1. Download Kubuntu 22.04
  2. Download Cubic: see https://launchpad.net/cubic
  3. Download Google chrome (renamed to google-chrome-stable.deb)
  4. Select the Ubuntu ISO in Cubic
  5. Copy the changescript and Chrome to the terminal in Cubic
  6. Type "bash c(tab)". Press enter at each prompt (can take 10 minutes, depending on your internet and storage speed)
  7. If the bash prompt is visible again, click "Next" and let it do it's thing
  8. Select the top kernel and follow the instructions on the bottem of the changescript
  9. Click "Next", select the compression method (lz4 for Alpha & Beta, xz for Stable)
  10. Click "Next" and it will finish the ISO (can take a few minutes, depending on your CPU speed)
